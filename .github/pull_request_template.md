Thank you for contributing to Stamp! We really appreciate it. Our mission is to spread P2P electronic cash to the world. 

Please note, due to common industry practices of re-packaging open source software by for-profit business, we have an unusual software license. This license provides open access to the software source code, and reproduction thereof by community (non-commercial) projects, but excludes use of reproductions, and repackaging, by other for-profit organizations.

As such, by opening this pull request you acknowledge that you are providing the owners of this project an unlimited license to use and reproduce your contribution.
